                                    NanJing Top Power ASIC Corp.                         TP4056

DESCRIPTION
The TP4056 is a complete constant-current/constant-voltage linear charger for single cell
lithium-ion batteries. It’s ESOP8/EMSOP8 package and low external component count
make the TP4056 ideally suited for portable applications. The TP4056 is designed to work
within USB power specifications (wall adaptor or USB supply).
No external sense resistor or blocking diode is required due to it’s internal PMOSFET
architecture and integrated reverse discharge protection. TP4056 limits the charge current
based on die temperature during high power operation or high ambient temperature. The
charge voltage is fixed at 4.2V, and the charge current can be programmed externally with
a resistor. TP4056 automatically terminates the charge cycle when the charge current drops
to 1/10th of the programmed value after reaching the final float voltage.
When input power supply is removed, TP4056 will enter a low current state with battery
drain current less than 2uA. TP4056 can also enter a shut-down mode with power supply,
lowering supply current to less than 55uA.
Other features include cell temperature monitor, under voltage lockout, automatic recharge
and two LED status indication pins for charge termination and presence of an input voltage.
