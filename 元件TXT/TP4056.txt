UMW TP4056
1A Linear Lithium - ION Battery Charger

1.Description
TP4056 is a high-performance single cell lithium-ion battery constant current/constant voltage linear charger. The
TP4056 adopts the ESOP8 package with fewer peripheral components, making it very suitable for portable products
and suitable for powering USB power supplies and adapter power supplies.
Based on the special internal MOSFET architecture and anti-reverse charging circuit, TP4056 does not require
external detection resistors and isolation diodes. When the external ambient temperature is too high or in high-power
applications, thermal feedback can adjust the charging current to reduce the chip temperature. The charging voltage
is fixed at 4.2V, and the charging current can be set externally through a resistor. When the charging current drops
to 1/10 of the set value after reaching the final floating charge voltage, the chip will terminate the charging cycle.
When the input voltage is disconnected, the TP4056 enters a sleep state and the battery leakage current drops
below 1uA. The TP4056 can be set in shutdown mode, in which case the chip quiescent current drops to 35uA.
TP4056 also includes other features: battery temperature monitoring, undervoltage lockout, automatic recharge
and two status pins to display charging and charge termination.

1A Linear Lithium - ION Battery Charger

11.Usage User Manual
TP4056 is a linear charger designed specifically for lithium-ion batteries. It uses the power MOSFET inside the chip
to charge the battery with constant current/constant voltage. The charging current can be determined by external
resistor programming, and the maximum charging current can reach 1000mA. TP4056 has two open-drain output
status indication output terminals, the charging status indication terminal CHRG and the battery charging completion
indication output terminal STDBY. The power tube circuit inside the chip automatically reduces the charging current
when the junction temperature of the chip exceeds 135℃. This function allows users to maximize the use of chip
charging without worrying about chip overheating and damage to the chip or external components.

Working Principle
When the input voltage exceeds the UVLO detection threshold and the chip enable input terminal CE is connected
to a high level, TP4056 starts charging the battery. If the battery voltage is below 2.9V, the charger will pre charge
the battery with a small current. When the battery voltage exceeds 2.9V, the charger adopts a constant current
mode to charge the battery, and the charging current is determined by the resistance between the prog terminal
and the gnd terminal. When the battery voltage approaches 4.2v, the charging current gradually decreases and
TP4056 enters constant voltage charging mode. When the charging current decreases to the charging end
threshold, the charging cycle ends.
The charge end threshold is 1/10 of the constant current charge current. When the battery voltage drops below the
recharge threshold, a new charge cycle automatically starts. The high-precision voltage reference source, error
amplifier and resistor divider network inside the chip ensure that the accuracy of the BAT modulation voltage is
within 1%, meeting the requirements of lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. When the input voltage is powered
off or the input voltage is lower than the battery voltage, the charger enters shutdown mode, and the current
consumed by the battery terminal is less than 2uA, thereby increasing the standby time.
If the enable input terminal ce is connected to a low level, the charger stops charging.

Charging Current Setting
The charging current is set by a resistor connected between the prog pin and ground. Determine the resistor value
according to the required charging current, and use the following formula to calculate the setting resistor and
charging current:

Charging Termination
When the charging current drops to 1/10 of the set value after reaching the final float voltage, the charging cycle is
terminated. This condition is detected by monitoring the PROG terminal with an internal filter comparator. When the
voltage at the PROG terminal drops below 100mV for more than 1.8ms, charging is terminated and the TP4056
enters standby mode, at which time the input power supply current drops to about 50uA.

During charging, transient loads on the BAT terminal can cause the PROG terminal voltage to drop below 100mV
briefly before the DC charging current drops to 1/10 of the set value. The 1.8ms delay time of the comparator
ensures that transient loads of this nature do not cause the charging cycle to terminate prematurely. Once the
average charging current drops below 1/10 of the set value, the TP4056 centralized charging cycle and stops
providing any current through the BAT terminal. In this state, all loads on the BAT terminal must be powered by the
battery.

Charging Status Indication
TP4056 has two open-drain status indication outputs chrg and stdby. When the charger is in the charging state,
chrg is pulled to a low level, and in other states chrg is in a high impedance state; when the battery is charged,
stdby is pulled to a low level, and in other states stdby is in a high impedance state.
When the battery is not connected to the charger, chrg flashes to indicate that the battery is not installed.

Thermal Limitation
If the chip temperature rises above 135 c, an internal thermal feedback loop will reduce the set charging current.
This function prevents TP4056 from overheating and allows the user to increase the upper limit of the power
handling capability of a given circuit board while reducing the risk of damaging TP4056.

Battery Temperature Detection
In order to prevent damage to the battery caused by excessively high or low temperatures, the TP4056 has an
internal battery temperature monitoring circuit. Battery temperature monitoring is achieved by measuring the voltage
of the TEMP pin, which is realized by the NTC thermistor in the battery and a resistor divider network, as shown in
the typical application diagram. If the voltage of the TEMP pin is less than 45% of the input voltage or greater than
80% of the input voltage, it means that the battery temperature is too low or too high, and charging is suspended.
If the temp pin is directly connected to gnd, the battery temperature detection function is canceled and other
charging functions are normal.

Determine the relationship between r1 and r2price
The values of r1 and r2 should be determined based on the temperature monitoring range of the battery and the
resistance value of the thermistor. Here is an example to illustrate:
Assuming the set battery temperature range is tl~th (where tl<th); The negative temperature coefficient thermistor
(NTC) is used in the battery. RTL is its resistance at temperature tl, and rth is its resistance at temperature th.

VTEMPL=

R2||RTL
R1+R2||RTL

x VIN

Therefore, RTL>rth. At temperature tl, the voltage at the first pin temp is:
At temperature th, the voltage of the first pin temp is:
VTEMPH=

R2||RTH
R1+R2||RTH

x VIN

Then, vtempl vhigh k 2 vcc (k 2 0.8)
VTEMPH=VLOW=K1 x VCC (K1=0.45)
Then it can be solved that:

R1=

RTLRTH(K2-K1)
(RTL-RTH)K1K2

R2=

RTLRTH(K2-K1)
RTL(K1-K1K2)-RTH(K2-K1K2)

Similarly, if the battery has a positive temperature coefficient (ptc) thermistor, then >, we can calculate:

R1=

RTLRTH(K2-K1)
(RTH-RTL)K1K2

R2=

RTLRTH(K2-K1)
RTH(K1-K1K2)-RTL(K2-K1K2)

From the above derivation, it can be seen that the temperature range to be set is independent of the power supply
voltage vcc, only related to r1, r2, rth, and rtl; Among them, rth and rtl can be obtained by consulting relevant battery
manuals or through experimental testing.

In practical applications, if we only focus on the temperature characteristics of one end, such as overheating
protection, then r2 can be omitted and only r1 can be used. The derivation of r1 has also become simple and will
not be repeated here.

Undervoltage locking
TP4056 has an internal undervoltage lockout circuit to monitor the input voltage and keep the chip in shutdown
mode before VCC rises to the undervoltage lockout threshold voltage. When the VCC voltage rises to 3.8V, the chip
exits UVLO and starts normal operation. The UVLO hysteresis voltage when VCC drops is 200mV.

Automatic Charging Cycle
After the battery voltage reaches the floating charge voltage and the charging cycle is terminated, the TP4056
immediately monitors the BAT terminal voltage. When the BAT terminal voltage is lower than 4.1V, the charging
cycle restarts. This ensures that the battery is maintained in a state close to full charge, while eliminating the need
to start the periodic charging cycle.

Battery Reverse Polarity Protection
TP4056 has a lithium battery reverse connection protection function. When the positive and negative poles of the
battery are reversely connected to the TP4056 voltage output BAT pin, TP4056 will stop and display a fault state,
and there is no charging current. The charging indicator pin is in a high impedance state, and RLED is off. At this
time, the reverse battery leakage current is less than 1mA. Connect the reverse battery correctly, and TP4056
automatically starts the charging cycle.
